# Pomoplan

Pomoplan is an application with the goal to make planning easier and more effective.

## How do I use it?

Start it up. Click the "+" button to add tasks, and categorize them based on how soon you want them done-- in a day, week, month, year, or longer/unknown. Also, make sure to chose how long you want to spend on the task. Pomoplan will automatically select a task based on it's priority and other factors, and start a Pomodoro-style timer at the bottom of the screen. You can then do the task. If you complete it, or run out of time, Pomoplan will give you a break then switch tasks.
