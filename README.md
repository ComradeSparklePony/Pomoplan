# Pomoplan

Pomoplan is an application with the goal to make planning easier and more effective.

## How do I use it?

1. Start it up
2. Add a new task by heading to the new tasks tab. Add a title and a priority (how long from now should it be done?).
3. Repeat step 2 for all tasks you need to remember how to do.
4. Once done adding tasks, head to the list of tasks, and do them.
5. When you finish a task, click on it to remove it from the list.

NOTE: Pomoplan is in-development software. How it is used will likely change as it is developed.
